Word Count Program

The program takes in a input file, a word, and the name of an output file. It then
finds the number of instances of the word in the input file, and the size of
the input file in bytes and prints both to the terminal and an output file.

Compile using the make command from the makefile or the following command:

gcc count.c -o count
